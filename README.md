# MMD

<p>Our teamâ€™s name is MMD, and our group consists of Mitzi Castro, Morgan Harvison, and Daniel Collier. We go to Madison Academic Magnet Highschool. Our original idea for our website was to have a product that is used to track items via gps. We called our product master finders. We later decided that this idea was boring and decided to change it. We ended up going with a website that sells merchandise for a band. The name of our band is MMD which is the first letter of each of our names.</p>
<br>
<p>In our website we first have a nav-bar that can take you to our home page, merchandise page, about page, or login page. On our home page the first thing you will see is a carousel that displays some of our products. If you scroll down, we have a picture of our manager as well as some information about him. Our manager happens to also be in the music industry however he is a rapper that goes by Big G. Under this we have a button that says not to click it. This is because it lists the usernames of the people who have placed a merchandise order.  If you go to our merchandise page you will be able to see our varies products and place an order. The about page has a picture of each band member with the story behind how each band member first became involved.  We then have a cart page and a sign up page.</p>
